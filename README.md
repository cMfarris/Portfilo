# Advanced CSS: Portfolio

Taking HTML and Advanced CSS applying it all together to make it into a profile of everything we have learned. You will use flexbox coding to make each individual boxs to apply the skills that you learn over the weeks in the course. As well as implmenting your own skills and knowledge.

# Resources 

I used w3schools, modules,and looking at previous actvities to help me break down each thing i need to use and have a understnding of it. You are doing all this from scratch so you are making your own index.html file and style.css as well as your own images. 

# Actions

I started by creating a html and style css and building it up to make a profilo to add your own style and tell about yourself. It was a common thing that we put everything we know about html,css,and advanced css to build it. As we go into the course more we will add more into to show everything we have learned.
